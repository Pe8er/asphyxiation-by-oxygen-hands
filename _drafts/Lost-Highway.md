David Lynch's death inspired me to rewatch my favorite movie of his: [Lost Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Highway_(film)). I was in high school when I saw it last and I was curious whether it aged or not. Not to mention the very disturbing and fond memories of it.<!--more-->

Needless to say, I was so enamored that I proceeded to take 246 screenshots during the movie. I was floored by the cinematography: the picture drowns in blackness, intertwined sparingly with shades of brown and gold. Composition is always perfect in this unforced, almost spontaneous, intuitive and organic way.

Also, is this a hat-tip towards [Angel Heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Heart)?

The sarcastic, direct sense of humor reminds me of the almost cheerful moments in Twin Peaks and seems to come straight from what I like to call (fairly geographically inaccurately) Lynch's midwestern roots. My brain just automatically connects his sense of humor, his straightforward and no-bullshit nature, with my experiences from that part of the US.

I don't remember noticing the ironic side of the main theme 20 years ago. Let's call it *relationship complications*: uncertainty, obsession, jealousy, all stemming from an awkwardly presented sense of masculinity. I love how Lynch plays with it all, perfectly walking the line between irony and mystery. After all, isn't it how paranoia works? At first it's meaningless, and the next moment it turns into a big deal, seemingly out of nowhere.

I remember thinking that Lynch made the dialogue between most characters sound  awkward and stiff to serve the overall surreal atmosphereâ€¦ several years and complicated relationships later, I don't see it that way anymore. This time around, dialogue felt much more closer to how it can be in real life when things are fucked up, cold and distant. But still, it is served with a pinch of grotesque comedy, it's so exaggerated and silly if you look at it from a distance.

I can't believe this: Lost Highway is a pretty funny movie.

On another note, I dug into the genesis of the movie and discovered several fun facts:

1. In terms of inspiration: David Lynch had a "Dick Laurent is dead" intercom moment in real life. Someone said these exact words into his intercom once, and he never found out who it was. There was another David living a few houses down from his place, so Lynch assumed they had the wrong address.
2. Another piece of inspiration: Lynch was obsessed with OJ Simpson's trial and particularly how he could go back to living a *normal* life after being proclaimed innocent. Lynch was wondering
> "how does the mind protect itself from this knowledge and go on"
3. Lynch thought of a condition where a person disassociates themselves from a traumatic event, which was the main theme of the film. Only later, Lynch found out he intuitively reached a real-world psychiatric condition, [Dissociative Fugue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_fugue).
4. It seems like Robert Blake, the actor who plays the devil, had a real-life OJ Simpson-like, Lost Highway-like dissociative fugue situation. In 2002, he was charged with murder of his wife, subsequently released due to insufficient evidence, and continued on to live his life in what perhaps was denial caused by dissociative fugue. He died in 2023. [His YouTube channel is still up](https://www.youtube.com/@robertblakeiaintdeadyetsos8532) and it's pretty weird.
5. In the first scene, Lynch wanted the main character to not be able to see the front door of the house from where they answer the intercom. Having failed to find an appropriate location after months of searching, he bought a house in Los Angeles hills and reconfigured it. Fantastic dedication to detail and realism, which paradoxically helps solidify the surreal outcome of the scene.

All in all, I'm happy that *Lost Highway* did not age a single day for me. I loved it even more than 20 years ago and was able to appreciate it differently, perhaps more deeply this time around.
