title: "Hi there, my name is Piotr [ pee oh-der ]"

Born and bred in a small town in south-western Poland, I earned my second, dark blue passport after 10 years of sweat in the deep and ruthless mines of Silicon Valley.

[My best friend](https://zama.ro) tells me my head is as big and round as a lightbulb[^1], which is pretty accurate geometrically and medically —— doctors suspected hydrocephaly when I was born, it was so unusual. Luckily they didn't find any water, just vacuum. Anyway, my point is my head has been big enough to carry half a ridiculous number of hats in my professional career: I've been a print and UX designer, game designer, product owner, scrum master, usability tester, innovation leader, sales engineer, team manager, brand manager in digital marketing, chief of staff, and a personal therapist to a number of executives. Seriously, whew.

I worked at a bunch of tech startups and one not-so-small company in the US. I worked too much, so after a decade I decided to pack up my stuff, drag the dog onto the plane, and we came back to Europe.

I'm proud that I won the Apple Design Award in 2006 for this:

I change hobbies like underwear. You will see me run, mountain bike, hike in the mountains, bite my dog's toys, take photos, headbang to thrash metal, make pots, read, cultivate my pretentiousness by watching highly pretentious movies and shows that feel like pretentious movies ([Slow Horses](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5875444/) or [The Offer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13111040/) anyone??), [write mostly useless shell scripts]({%- post_url 2025-01-01-Homelab-Introduction -%}), cook, travel, study contemporary philosophy and geopolitics…and whatever else I can get my hands on to generate dopamine.

I like to sleep well and get sun in the morning. Oh and holy shit, I'm at the very very deep end of specialty coffee rabbit hole.

Do you want to shoot the shit or do something together? Or just say hi? Or send me an empty message with heavy breathing noises? [Drop me a line](mailto:hello@pgajos.com).
