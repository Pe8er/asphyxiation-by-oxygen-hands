A throwback to the ancient history of UI customization, part two: circa 2005, my so-called career as a designer received a huge boost when Phill Ryu asked me to participate in the Shapeshifter theme contest, organized to celebrate the re-opening of MacThemes forum. <!--more-->If you joined the party after 2008, most likely none of these things mean anything to you. A quick history lesson then:

- [Shapeshifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsanity) was a badass OS X theming engine, developed by the even more badass [Jason Harris](https://github.com/smeger).
- MacThemes was the mecca of Mac UI customization, a forum gathering the most exquisite UI design talent back then. Nothing like the fancy-pants-always-nice dribbble club, it was a place for *real men* with *real pixels*.
- Phill Ryu was a wonderfully talented douche man. Everyone *kind of hated him* but nobody could deny his marketing and product intuition. Where are you now, Phill?

Anyway, where was I… Phil pulled me out of my [Aqua-Soft](https://aqua-soft.org/forum/) den and asked to produce an entry for the contest. At the time I was reading [Jacek Dukaj's *Perfekcyjna Niedoskonałość*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Imperfection) (eng. The Perfect Imperfection): an utterly insane, super heavy sci-fi cyberpunk novel about a post-gender and post-human world. Think *Ghost In The Shell: Innocence*, all philosophical aspects of it extracted and amplified ten-fold. Plus a million other incredible ideas. If you know Polish and know how to read, Dukaj is a must. Otherwise check out [this plot summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Imperfection#Plot), so at least you know what you're missing out on.

But I digress again…this book's cover became the foundation of my concept. *Unguibus et Rostro* is latin for "with talons and beak", one of main character's family credo. I thought it was odd enough to be fitting through juxtaposition. Book cover, created by the amazing [Tomasz Bagiński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasz_Bagi%C5%84ski), became the color palette of my theme. And finally the story, themes, tropes and overall atmosphere inspired the look I went for: futuristic, minimalist, dark and glowy. That was my idea of ultra-futuristic cyberpunk back in 2005 anyway.

Here's what it looked like originally:

Can you see that sexy iDisk icon?? A train of nostalgia hit me recently, and so I decided to recreate the concept in Sketch, with some visual refinements and according to the current OS X UI metrics. Here's the effect:

I think it came out pretty well: it looks sort of contemporary, albeit with an ever so delicate aftertaste of gaudiness. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree, you can grab the source file for *Unguibus et Rostro*. It's gluten free!

This is the story then. I like to remember my design origins, and it's fun to step back into the world where touch screen smart phones did not exist. ~~Ha, speaking of which: check me out spreading rumors about the first iPhone back in 2007.~~ Hard to believe it was nine years ago.

I trust there's a small circle of people who will shed a tear of warm nostalgia along with me. I dedicate this trip to you, freaks from Aqua-Soft and MacThemes: Timan, wizard, Seph, Unbeliever, Ji Eun, Stefanka, AndreasV, bh2, gnomexp, herd, nightcrawler1089, flyakite, jef, judge, Phil Li of course…and dozens of others whose names I can't remember anymore. Good times!
