I'm using a somewhat ancient Raspberry Pi 3B+ as a home server and NAS. This series of posts summarizes the steps I took to get up an running. 90% of it was me following [Pi My Life Up](https://pimylifeup.com/).

1. [Miscellaneous Setup (networking, external drive mounting, etc.)](/Homelab-1-Misc-Setup)
2. [Installing apps via Docker (portainer, transmission-web, lidarr, prowlarr)](/Homelab-2-Installing-Apps)
3. [Plex Media Server](/Homelab-3-Plex)
4. [Calibre Web](/Homelab-4-Calibre)
5. [Reducing External Hard Drive Noise](/Homelab-5-HDD-Noise/)
