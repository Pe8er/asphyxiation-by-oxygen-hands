I'm using a somewhat ancient Raspberry Pi 3B+ as a home server and NAS. This series of posts summarizes the steps I took to get it all up an running. <!--more-->90% of it was me following [Pi My Life Up](https://pimylifeup.com/). I decided to write it all down on my blog to document my specific setup, in case my Pi explodes (which it probably will) before I back it up (which I will definitely not remember to do) and I have to do it all over again.
