Surprised how much I liked it. It was so authentic, flowing and real. I didn't want it to end. Gorgeous cinematography by [Yunus Roy Imer](https://yunusroyimer.com/), stayed so close to the characters and the nature.

I'm not religious at all, but the AA prayer resonated with me:

> God grant me the serenity<br />
> To accept the things I cannot change;<br />
> Courage to change the things I can;<br />
> And wisdom to know the difference.

Especially because it was serendipitously brought up by my therapist a couple weeks later.

Also, is there a faint connection to Margaret Atwood's [Oryx and Crake](https://www.oryxandcrake.co.uk/)?
