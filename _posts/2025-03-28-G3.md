I acquired a new server: the tiny, affordable GMKtec NucBox G3. It replaces the Raspberry Pi 3B I've had for what feels like an eternity. I installed Ubuntu 25.04 on it, and so here's a recording of how I set it up.

## System Stuff

### Static IP

Instructions are stolen [from this article.](https://learnubuntu.com/set-static-ip/)

Check if `cloud-init` is installed:

`apt-cache pkgnames | grep cloud-init`

If you get an output, you have 'cloud-init' installed.

Now, to disable could-init, create a new file inside `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d` directory:

`sudoedit /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-cloud-init.cfg`

Add the following line to it:

`network: {config: disabled}`

Reboot the system: `sudo reboot now` and afterwards, create a new config file:

`sudoedit /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml`

With the following content:

```yaml
network:
  ethernets:
    enp3s0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.199/24
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8]
  version: 2
```

`sudo netplan apply`

Check if it worked: `hostname -I`

### Disable WiFi

`sudo nmcli radio wifi off`

### SSH without Password

[Same as on Pi](/Homelab-Misc-Setup/#ssh-without-password)

### Mount External Drives

[Same as on Pi](/Homelab-Misc-Setup/#mount-external-hard-drive)

### Samba Sharing

[Same as on Pi](/Homelab-Misc-Setup/#samba-share-for-easy-file-management)

## Apps

### Same as on Pi

For several pieces, I was able to follow the same procedures as in my previous Raspberry Pi setup:

- Syncthing (or simply [follow the official documentation](https://apt.syncthing.net/))
- Docker (or [follow the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository))
- [Portainer](/Homelab-Installing-Apps/#portainer)
- [Tailscale](/Homelab-Installing-Apps/#magic-of-remote-access-tailscale)
- [Transmission](/Homelab-Installing-Apps/#transmission)
- [Plex Media Server](/Homelab-Plex/#plex-media-server)

And then, we have new goodies!!

### Watchtower

This keeps containers updated automatically. First, install Shoutrrr to make sending Watchtower notifications easy:

```bash
sudo snap install shoutrrr
```

And then pop this into Portainer:

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
    watchtower:
        image: beatkind/watchtower
        secrets:
            - ntfy_username
            - ntfy_password
        volumes:
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
        environment:
            WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_URL=ntfy://NTFY.USERNAME:NTFY.PASSWORD@192.168.1.199:8787/watchtower?Scheme=http
            WATCHTOWER_DISABLE_CONTAINERS=immich_server immich_machine_learning immich_redis immich_postgres

secrets:
    ntfy-username:
        file: /home/pe8er/.secrets/ntfy-username
    ntfy-password:
        file: /home/pe8er/.secrets/ntfy-password
```

### MusicBrainz Picard

I tried hard to like Lidarr but realized I didn't need all the complexity and maintenance it required. I'm not a hoarder, I'm rather intentional as far as music is concerned, so I don't need to any automation for music downloads. And what is quite important to me: Picard gives me full control over the tagging process, whereas in Lidarr it was automated and rather opaque to me.

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  picard:
    ports:
      - 5800:5800
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/picard:/config:rw
      - /home/pe8er/Downloads:/downloads:rw
      - /mnt/ssd-sandisk/Music:/music:rw
    image: mikenye/picard:latest
```

And my file rename script (or [grab the gist](https://gist.github.com/Pe8er/270b524e5d48dfd3fa23b97d5e6a0062#file-0000-album_00-title-m4a-ptsp)):

```bash
%albumartist%/\($if(%originalyear%,%originalyear%,$if(%date%,$left(%date%,4),0000))\) %album%/$if($gt(%totaldiscs%,1),%discnumber%-)$num(%tracknumber%,2) $if2(%albumartist%,%artist%) - %title%
```

### Radarr

Radarr manages movie grabbing and management. I prefer this way to grab new movies instead of manual search because it's much faster and less cognitively intensive for me.

```yaml
---
version: '3.3'
secrets:
    ntfy-username:
        file: /home/pe8er/.secrets/ntfy-username
    ntfy-password:
        file: /home/pe8er/.secrets/ntfy-password
services:
    watchtower:
        image: beatkind/watchtower
        secrets:
            - ntfy-username
            - ntfy-password
        volumes:
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
        environment:
            WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_URL: ntfy://pe8er:aszx@192.168.1.199:8787/watchtower?Scheme=http
            WATCHTOWER_DISABLE_CONTAINERS: immich_server immich_machine_learning immich_redis immich_postgres
        restart: unless-stopped
```

### Prowlarr

I need this to easily add indexers to *arr apps. It replaces Jackett.

```yaml
---
services:
  prowlarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr:latest
    container_name: prowlarr
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Warsaw
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/prowlarr:/config
      - /home/pe8er/:/data
    ports:
      - 9696:9696
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Immich

A self-hosted photo library / backup app with pretty solid UX. [Solid Docker instructions on Immich website](https://immich.app/docs/install/docker-compose).

### Homepage

A simple web app dashboard which I use as a visual bookmark for all my server apps. [Website](https://gethomepage.dev/).

```yaml
services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/homepage:/app/config
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS: gethomepage.dev,*
```

### JDownloader2

A handy download manager.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jdownloader-2:
    image: jlesage/jdownloader-2
    ports:
      - "666:5800"
    volumes:
      - "/home/pe8er/docker/jdownloader2:/config:rw"
      - "/home/pe8er/Downloads:/output:rw"
    environment:
      - WEB_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=pe8er
      - WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD=[PASSWORD]
      - MYJDOWNLOADER_DEVICE_NAME=jdownloader2
```

And JDownloader2 should be available at:

```conf
http://[SERVER IP]:666
```

### ntfy.sh

I used [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) for years until I switched to an Android phone and discovered that I need to pay for the Android app. Well, as it turns out one can self-host a notification server: [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/)! Pushover worked well for me but ntfy seems to be much simpler in practice. Love it!

Before installing the docker image, I created necessary directories and grabbed the configuration file, which I ended up not using at all.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/pe8er/docker/ntfy/cache/ntfy
mkdir -p /home/pe8er/docker/ntfy/etc/ntfy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/refs/heads/main/server/server.yml
```

And then comes the docker compose:

```yaml
services:
  ntfy:
    image: binwiederhier/ntfy
    container_name: ntfy
    command:
      - serve
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Warsaw
    user: 1000:1000
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/ntfy/cache/ntfy:/var/cache/ntfy
      - /home/pe8er/docker/ntfy/etc/ntfy:/etc/ntfy
    ports:
      - 8787:80
    healthcheck: # optional: remember to adapt the host:port to your environment
        test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget -q --tries=1 http://localhost:80/v1/health -O - | grep -Eo '\"healthy\"\\s*:\\s*true' || exit 1"]
        interval: 60s
        timeout: 10s
        retries: 3
        start_period: 40s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

It works by sending commands such as this:

```bash
curl -d "Dang 😀" 192.168.1.199:8787/all
```

Or it can get more elaborate, like this:

```bash
curl \
  -H "$TITLE" \
  -H "Tags: skull" \
  -d "$MESSAGE" \
  $NTFYSERVER
```

What is absolutely amazing for me is that I can send emoji with images, using [emoji short codes](https://docs.ntfy.sh/emojis/). So much fun.

### Home Assistant

My girlfriend has an iPhone, I have an Android phone. We have a bunch of HomeKit lights. Therefore, Home Assistant:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name homeassistant \
  --privileged \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  -e TZ=Europe/Warsaw \
  -v /home/pe8er/docker/homeassistant:/config \
  -v /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro \
  --network=host \
  ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable
```

Is it running? Check the URL:

```bash
http://192.168.1.199:8123
```
