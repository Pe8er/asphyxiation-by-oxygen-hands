I got a new server: the tiny, affordable GMKtec NucBox G3. It replaces the Raspberry Pi 3B I've had for what feels like an eternity. I installed Ubuntu 25.04 on it, and so here's a recording of how I set it up.

## System Stuff

### Static IP

Instructions are stolen [from this article.](https://learnubuntu.com/set-static-ip/)

Check if `cloud-init` is installed:

`apt-cache pkgnames | grep cloud-init`

If you get an output, you have 'cloud-init' installed.

Now, to disable could-init, create a new file inside `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d` directory:

`sudoedit /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-cloud-init.cfg`

Add the following line to it:

`network: {config: disabled}`

Reboot the system: `sudo reboot now` and afterwards, create a new config file:

`sudoedit /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml`

With the following content:

```yaml
network:
  ethernets:
    enp3s0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.199/24
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8]
  version: 2
```

`sudo netplan apply`

Check if it worked: `hostname -I`

### Disable WiFi

`sudo nmcli radio wifi off`

### SSH without Password

[Same as on Pi](/Homelab-Misc-Setup/#ssh-without-password)

### Mount External Drives

[Same as on Pi](/Homelab-Misc-Setup/#mount-external-hard-drive)

### Samba Sharing

[Same as on Pi](/Homelab-Misc-Setup/#samba-share-for-easy-file-management)

## Apps

### Same as on Pi

For several pieces, I was able to follow the same procedures as in my previous Raspberry Pi setup:

- Syncthing (or simply [follow the official documentation](https://apt.syncthing.net/))
- Docker (or [follow the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository))
- [Portainer](/Homelab-Installing-Apps/#portainer)
- [Tailscale](/Homelab-Installing-Apps/#magic-of-remote-access-tailscale)
- [Transmission](/Homelab-Installing-Apps/#transmission)
- [Plex Media Server](/Homelab-Plex/#plex-media-server)

And then, we have new goodies!!

### Borg Backup with Borgmatic

TBD

### Watchtower

This keeps containers updated automatically. First, install Shoutrrr to make sending Watchtower notifications easy:

```bash
sudo snap install shoutrrr
```

And then pop this into Portainer:

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  watchtower:
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment: WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_URL=pushover://shoutrrr:[TOKEN_APP]@[TOKEN_USER]/
    image: beatkind/watchtower
```

### MusicBrainz Picard

I tried hard to like Lidarr but realized I didn't need all the complexity and maintenance it required. I'm not a hoarder, I'm rather intentional as far as music is concerned, so I don't need to any automation for music downloads. And what is quite important to me: Picard gives me full control over the tagging process, whereas in Lidarr it was automated and rather opaque to me.

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  picard:
    ports:
      - 5800:5800
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/picard:/config:rw
      - /home/pe8er/Downloads:/downloads:rw
      - /mnt/ssd-sandisk/Music:/music:rw
    image: mikenye/picard:latest
```

And my file rename script (or [grab the gist](https://gist.github.com/Pe8er/270b524e5d48dfd3fa23b97d5e6a0062#file-0000-album_00-title-m4a-ptsp)):

```
%albumartist%/\($if(%originalyear%,%originalyear%,$if(%date%,$left(%date%,4),0000))\) %album%/$if($gt(%totaldiscs%,1),%discnumber%-)$num(%tracknumber%,2) $if2(%albumartist%,%artist%) - %title%
```

### Radarr

Radarr manages movie grabbing and management. I prefer this way to grab new movies instead of manual search because it's much faster and less cognitively intensive for me.

```yaml
---
services:
  radarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr:latest
    container_name: radarr
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Warsaw
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/radarr:/config
      - /home/pe8er:/data
    ports:
      - 7878:7878
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Prowlarr

I need this to easily add indexers to *arr apps. It replaces Jackett.

```yaml
---
services:
  prowlarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr:latest
    container_name: prowlarr
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Warsaw
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/prowlarr:/config
      - /home/pe8er/:/data
    ports:
      - 9696:9696
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Immich

A self-hosted photo library / backup app with pretty solid UX. [Solid Docker instructions on Immich website](https://immich.app/docs/install/docker-compose).

### Homepage

A simple web app dashboard which I use as a visual bookmark for all my server apps. [Website](https://gethomepage.dev/).

```yaml
services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - /home/pe8er/docker/homepage:/app/config
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS: gethomepage.dev,*
```

### JDownloader2

A handy download manager.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  jdownloader-2:
    image: jlesage/jdownloader-2
    ports:
      - "666:5800"
    volumes:
      - "/home/pe8er/docker/jdownloader2:/config:rw"
      - "/home/pe8er/Downloads:/output:rw"
    environment:
      - WEB_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=pe8er
      - WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD=[PASSWORD]
      - MYJDOWNLOADER_DEVICE_NAME=jdownloader2
```

And JDownloader2 should be available at:

```conf
http://[SERVER IP]:666
```
